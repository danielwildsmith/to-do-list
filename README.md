## About
This project allowed me to use the skills I learned through the The Odin Project's Foundations course while also allowing me to learn new skills. The focus here was DOM manipulation with JavaScript and using the local storage API.

Definitely a simple and common project, but a solid test of the knowledge I've picked up so far.
